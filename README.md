# health-block

The back-end of an application (POC) that provides an interface between registered hospitals and potential patients, allowing people to get in touch with doctors from registered hospitals.
The application allows its users to store their health records following proper encryption practices, which can be accessed by them while they communicate with the relevant doctors via the app.
